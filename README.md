# WIRTEC-CCSComApp

Short description:

CSS ComApp is an application that was developed for the use of students in the College of Computer Studies in DLSU Taft, Manila. This application focuses on allowing such students to have a tool that they can utilize for information with regards to their classes and its accompanying professors, along with forums and frequently asked questions to address any issues that the students would have with regards to their college life. As such, the four main functionalities of this application are Courses, Professors, Forum, and DLSU FAQ. 
Students can view all the courses available throughout the whole of CCS, and can search through such list to get information about a specific course that include an overview of the course, possible professors who teach the course, and available notes of lectures created by students for the course as well. Similarly, they can view and search for all professors associated with the college, and rate and write reviews about them. Students can create forums for discussion, which can be liked, disliked or replied to by any other student as well. All matters that are frequently asked are listed in the DLSU FAQ. 
Highlighted features:
-	Association with DLSU email accounts only
-	Live Notifications
-	Interaction with other students over the Internet
-	Readily accessible tool for an abundance of data on CCS
This application was developed by BSIT students Andrew Santiago, Carlos Garcia, and Enrico Zabayle as a major requirement for their course, WIR-TEC, under the guidance of Professor Edward Tighe.
